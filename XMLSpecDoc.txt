This document describes the format of parts.xml. It is divided into
sections for the different versions.

==================
Version 2.0
=================

Basic Format

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<LDraw-Library>
<Version Number="2" />
<LDRAWDIR>%LDRAWDIR%</LDRAWDIR>
<OS-Properties Style="{DOS/POSIX}" />

<FileEntry ...>
</FileEntry>

<FileEntry ...>
</FileEntry>
...
</LDraw-Library>

The file is encoded as xml version 1.0 in UTF-8. LDMakeList will
ensure that the file is indeed UTF-8. All parts and primitives are
listed as sub-elements within the <LDraw-Library> tag.

The header information is:
_OS-Properties_ Has sttribute Style which must be DOS or POSIX

The _LDraw-Library_ header information is
_Version_ Number=2, Sub=??
_LDRAWDIR_ The top-level LDraw directory used to create the
  library. Default will be environment "LDRAWDIR" unless the user
  specified a specific directory to use or it was undefined.

Each file (primitive or part) has a _FileEntry_ and these can be
multiple. They have the following format:

<FileEntry Filetype="Part"  [IsAlias="True"] [IsPhsyicalColour="True"]
 IsOfficial="True/False"
 NameEntry="30103.dat" 
 Description="Animal Bat" 
 Author="Andy Westrate"  Username="westrate"
 Category="Animal" 
 License="Redistributable under CCAL version 2.0 : see CAreadme.txt" 
 FilenameWithPath="%LDRAWDIR%\PARTS\30103.dat" 
 >
[<Keyword>A</Keyword><Keyword>B</Keyword><Keyword>C</Keyword>]
<BFC Certify="True/False" [Winding="CCW"] />
[<History Date="2009-12-29" Username="PTadmin" >Official Update 2009-03</History>]
<History Date="2004-12-13" Username="Random" >Didn't really happen</History>]
[<Help>Help text goes here
over multiple lines</Help>]
</FileEntry>
